# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Predicting the price of cryptocurrencies is one of the popular case studies in the data science community.Buying and selling result in a change in the price of any cryptocurrency, but buying and selling trends depend on many factors. Using machine learning for cryptocurrency price prediction can only work in situations where prices change due to historical prices that people see before buying and selling their cryptocurrency.
# Libraries Installed:
We installed 2 libraries which are:

1.yfinance - yfinance is an API provided by Yahoo Finance to collect the latest stock price data.It will fetch the latest stock price everytime we run the code. For this we have to run the pip command in the terminal window which is pip install yfinance
